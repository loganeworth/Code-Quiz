# Code-Quiz-HW4

## Description

The goal of this project was to apply what we have learned about JavaScript to a quiz we make from scratch. The quiz is initiated by a start quiz button, and the time remainin can be viewed in the top left corner of the web page. For every question that you get wrong, you lose 5 seconds. For every question you get right, you gain 1 second. Once, you have completed the quiz you are presented with a form to enter your username/initials, that will be logged to the localstorage.
